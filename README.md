# WRKPCSPLF
Call the PC based spool file utility in ACS from a green screen command
ACS has a wonderful spool file utility that can be called from the pulldown "Actions/Printer Output" 
My users wanted a way to access this spoolfile utility from a 5250 menu option
To use add a menu option call wrkpcsplf and it will call the ACS based tool.
This assumes that you have ACS already loaded on the client machine
